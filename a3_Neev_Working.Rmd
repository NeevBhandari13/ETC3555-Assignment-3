####  Predictor Variables (X)

The predictor variables used in this analysis represent a wide range of patient characteristics and clinical measurements, including:

**Vital Signs:** These include minimum, maximum, and mean values of heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SysBP), diastolic blood pressure (DiasBP), respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation (SpO2). These are critical indicators of a patient's physiological condition during their ICU stay.

**Demographic Information:** Variables such as GENDER, DOB (date of birth), and ETHNICITY provide insight into the patient’s background.

**Admission Information:** Variables like ADMITTIME, ADMISSION_TYPE, and INSURANCE indicate the circumstances and context of the patient’s hospital admission.

**Diagnosis Information:** The DIAGNOSIS variable captures the primary diagnosis at the time of ICU admission, while ICD9_diagnosis provides the corresponding ICD-9 code.

##### Independent Variables: mimic_train_X.csv

**subject_id**: Unique identifier for each patient.
**hadm_id**: Hospital admission ID, unique for each hospital admission.
**icustay_id**: Unique identifier for each ICU stay.
**HeartRate_Min**: The minimum heart rate recorded during the ICU stay.
**HeartRate_Max**: The maximum heart rate recorded during the ICU stay.
**HeartRate_Mean**: The average heart rate during the ICU stay.
**SysBP_Min**: Minimum systolic blood pressure recorded during the ICU stay.
**SysBP_Max**: Maximum systolic blood pressure recorded during the ICU stay.
**SysBP_Mean**: The average systolic blood pressure during the ICU stay.
**DiasBP_Min**: Minimum diastolic blood pressure recorded during the ICU stay.
**DiasBP_Max**: Maximum diastolic blood pressure recorded during the ICU stay.
**DiasBP_Mean**: The average diastolic blood pressure during the ICU stay.
**MeanBP_Min**: Minimum mean arterial blood pressure recorded during the ICU stay.
**MeanBP_Max**: Maximum mean arterial blood pressure recorded during the ICU stay.
**MeanBP_Mean**: The average mean arterial blood pressure during the ICU stay.
**RespRate_Min**: Minimum respiratory rate recorded during the ICU stay.
**RespRate_Max**: Maximum respiratory rate recorded during the ICU stay.
**RespRate_Mean**: The average respiratory rate during the ICU stay.
**TempC_Min**: Minimum body temperature (in Celsius) recorded during the ICU stay.
**TempC_Max**: Maximum body temperature (in Celsius) recorded during the ICU stay.
**TempC_Mean**: The average body temperature (in Celsius) during the ICU stay.
**SpO2_Min**: Minimum oxygen saturation (SpO2) level recorded during the ICU stay.
**SpO2_Max**: Maximum oxygen saturation (SpO2) level recorded during the ICU stay.
**SpO2_Mean**: The average oxygen saturation (SpO2) level during the ICU stay.
**Glucose_Min**: Minimum blood glucose level recorded during the ICU stay.
**Glucose_Max**: Maximum blood glucose level recorded during the ICU stay.
**Glucose_Mean**: The average blood glucose level during the ICU stay.

**GENDER**: Gender of the patient.
**DOB**: Date of birth of the patient.
**ADMITTIME**: Timestamp of the patient's hospital admission.
**Diff**: Time difference between hospital admission and another event.
**ADMISSION_TYPE**: Type of admission (e.g., Emergency, Elective).
**INSURANCE**: Patient's insurance type.
**RELIGION**: Patient’s religion.
**MARITAL_STATUS**: Marital status of the patient.
**ETHNICITY**: Patient’s ethnicity.
**DIAGNOSIS**: Initial diagnosis at the time of ICU admission.
**ICD9_diagnosis**: The main diagnosis code in the ICD-9 system.
**FIRST_CAREUNIT**: The first ICU care unit the patient was admitted to (e.g., MICU, SICU, TSICU).


#### Target Variables (Y)

Two possible target variables (dependent variables) are of interest in this analysis:

**HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG:** A binary variable that indicates whether the patient passed away during their hospital stay (1 = expired, 0 = survived). This will be used for classification tasks.

**LOS (Length of Stay):** A continuous variable representing the total number of days a patient stayed in the hospital. This will be used for regression tasks aimed at predicting the duration of the patient’s stay.
